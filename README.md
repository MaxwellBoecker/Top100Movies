This is a project that I am using to practice writing tests as well as performing back-end CRUD operations with a PostgreSQL database. And authentication with Google OAuth2. The next steps are to write tests for all routes and DB functions, eventually tests for the (very basic) front-end as well. Then I will focus on optimizing my queries.
