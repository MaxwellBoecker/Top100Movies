# Top100Movies
Top 100 movies allows user to search movies from TMDB and add them to their list of favorites. They can also remove the movies from favorites. Soon a user search feature will be possible to view other profiles. Also, profile editing and features such as bio will ba available on the profile tab. 
This is a project that I created to practice writing raw Postgres queries with the Node 'pg' module, as well as unit/integration tests with a database and authenticated routes. Authentication is done with Google OAuth2. The next steps are to write tests for all routes and DB functions, eventually tests for the (very basic) front-end as well. Then I will focus on optimizing my queries.
